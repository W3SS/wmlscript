WMLScript Bytecode Translator
=============================

The language WMLScript is a subset of ECMAScript (ie JavaScript).
WMLScript defines also an bytecode interpreter (stack based), a binary
format.

WMLScript is a part of the Wireless Application Protocol specifications.

This translator transforms WMLScript bytecode into PIR language
which could executed by the Parrot VM (http://www.parrot.org).

A WMLScript Compiler is available on CPAN
(http://search.cpan.org/~perrad/WAP-wmls/).
