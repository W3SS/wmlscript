=head1 Status of WMLScript Translator

=head2 Introduction

The language WMLScript is a subset of ECMAScript (ie JavaScript).
WMLScript defines also an bytecode interpreter (stack based), a binary format.

WMLScript is a part of the Wireless Application Protocol specifications.

The complete specification are available on
L<http://www.openmobilealliance.org/> (formerly L<http://www.wapforum.org/>)

=head2 Translator

The translator is in 3 files C<src/script.pir>, C<src/opcode.pir>
(generated by C<build/translator.pl> from C<src/translation.rules>) and
C<src/stdlibs.pir> (generated by C<build/stdlibs.pl> from C<src/wmlslib.cfg>).

There are 4 applications :

=over 4

=item * F<wmlsd.pir> : a disassembler

=item * F<wmls2pir.pir> : a PIR translator

=item * F<wmls2pbc.pir> : a PIR translator & PBC compiler

=item * F<wmlsi.pir> : an interpreter

=back

The design of the Translator & Stack to Register Mapping comes from the
Jonathan Worthington's work (see F<languages/dotnet/doc/contents.pod>).

=head3 TODO

Find optimization (like Register or OptRegister) compatible with opcodes
SCAND & SCOR. These 2 opcodes pop one value, and push one I<or> two values.

=head2 WMLScript PMC

F<languages/WMLScript/pmc/wmlsbytecode.pmc> is a singleton PMC what holds
a method C<load>. This method is used to decode Bytecode File Format.

There are five types in WMLScript, each of them is implemented by a PMC.

=item * Integer F<dynext/pmc/wmlsinteger.pmc>

=item * Floating-Point F<dynext/pmc/wmlsfloat.pmc>

=item * String F<dynext/pmc/wmlsstring.pmc>

=item * Boolean F<dynext/pmc/wmlsboolean.pmc>

=item * Invalid F<dynext/pmc/wmlsinvalid.pmc>

=back

=head2 WMLScript Ops

F<dynext/ops/wmls.ops> defines opcode with new signature.

=head2 WMLScript Standard Libraries

Some of these libraries are implemented in :

=over 4

=item * Lang F<wmlscript/library/wmlslang.pir>

=item * Float F<wmlscript/library/wmlsfloat.pir>

=item * String F<wmlscript/library/wmlsstring.pir>

=item * Console F<wmlscript/library/wmlsconsole.pir>

=back

F<wmlscript/wmlsstdlibs.pir> gives an unique entry point
and implements some helpers.

=head3 TODO

Some of these libraries are incomplete.
